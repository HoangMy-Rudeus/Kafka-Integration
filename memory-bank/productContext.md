# Product Context

## Problem Domain
**Microservices Communication and Event-Driven Architecture**

The project addresses the challenge of building resilient, scalable distributed systems where services need to communicate asynchronously without tight coupling.

## Business Value
1. **Educational Resource** - Provides clear, working examples of microservices patterns
2. **Architecture Reference** - Demonstrates best practices for event-driven design
3. **Technology Showcase** - Shows integration of .NET, Kafka, Docker ecosystem
4. **Development Template** - Serves as foundation for real-world microservices projects

## Core Use Cases

### Primary Workflows
1. **Order Processing Flow**
   - Customer creates order via API
   - System publishes OrderCreated event
   - Inventory service reserves products
   - Notification service sends confirmation

2. **Inventory Management**
   - Real-time inventory tracking
   - Automatic reservation on orders
   - Stock level monitoring

3. **Customer Notifications**
   - Order confirmation messages
   - Inventory status updates
   - Event-driven communication

## Target Audience
- **Software Developers** learning microservices patterns
- **System Architects** designing distributed systems
- **DevOps Engineers** implementing containerized solutions
- **Students** studying modern software architecture

## Success Metrics
- Services communicate successfully via Kafka
- Zero data loss in message passing
- Services remain decoupled and independently deployable
- Clear demonstration of async patterns
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently
- **Resilience**: System handles service failures gracefully
- **Observability**: Clear logging and monitoring capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Clean, documented, testable code
- **Performance**: Low-latency message processing
