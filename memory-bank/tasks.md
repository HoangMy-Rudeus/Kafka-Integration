# Tasks

## Active Tasks

### Task 1: Memory Bank Initialization âœ…

**Status**: Completed  
**Scenario**: [To be defined]  
**System Scheme**: [C1/C2 to be created]  
**Description**: Initialize Memory Bank structure and foundational documentation

**Completed Items**:

- âœ… Created memory-bank directory structure
- âœ… Created projectbrief.md with complexity assessment
- âœ… Created productContext.md with business context
- âœ… Created techContext.md with technology stack
- âœ… Updated activeContext.md with current status

### Task 2: System Scheme Definition âœ…

**Status**: Completed  
**Scenario**: [To be defined]  
**System Scheme**: C1 - System Architecture Overview + C2 - Component Architecture  
**Description**: Create comprehensive system-level and component-level architecture descriptions

**Completed Items**:

- âœ… Created C1 system scheme with high-level architecture overview
- âœ… Created C2 component scheme with detailed service breakdowns
- âœ… Documented event flow patterns and integration points
- âœ… Updated architect document with component analysis
- âœ… Established architectural decisions and considerations

**Architectural Artifacts Created**:

- âœ… `memory-bank/system-schemes/c1.md` - System-level architecture
- âœ… `memory-bank/system-schemes/c2.md` - Component-level design
- âœ… `memory-bank/architect.md` - Architectural decisions record
- Define C2 (component-level) architecture scheme  
- Document service interactions and data flows
- Establish system boundaries and integration points

### Task 3: User Scenario Creation ðŸ“‹

**Status**: Not Started  
**Scenario**: [To be created]  
**System Scheme**: [TBD]  
**Description**: Define user interaction scenarios with actors and touchpoints

**Requirements**:

- Identify key actors (developers, architects, students)
- Define touchpoints (APIs, UIs, documentation)
- Create scenario files in memory-bank/scenarios structure
- Map scenarios to system components

### Task 4: Kafka Integration Enhancement ðŸ“‹

**Status**: Not Started  
**Scenario**: [To be defined]  
**System Scheme**: C2 - Component Integration  
**Description**: Convert simulated Kafka consumers to actual Kafka connectivity

**Requirements**:

- Replace simulation mode with real Kafka consumers
- Implement proper Confluent.Kafka integration
- Add error handling and retry mechanisms
- Validate end-to-end event processing

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Project Analysis and Assessment

- Analyzed existing codebase and architecture
- Identified complexity level (Level 2-3)
- Assessed current implementation status
- Created comprehensive demo scripts

## Task Planning Notes

**Priority Order**:

1. Complete system scheme definitions (C1/C2)
2. Create user scenarios for guidance
3. Plan Kafka integration improvements
4. Define additional enhancement opportunities

**Dependencies**:

- System schemes needed before detailed implementation planning
- User scenarios help prioritize feature development
- Memory Bank serves as coordination point for all tasks

**Success Criteria**:

- Memory Bank serves as single source of truth
- Clear task tracking and progress visibility
- System schemes provide architectural guidance
- User scenarios drive feature priorities
