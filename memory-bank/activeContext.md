# Active Context

## Current Focus

**Architect Mode - System Architecture Design and Component Planning**

## Current Goals

- ✅ Design comprehensive system architecture (C1 level) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Define component interactions and boundaries (C2 level) - COMPLETED  
- ✅ Establish architectural patterns and principles - COMPLETED
- ✅ Plan scalability and resilience strategies - COMPLETED
- 🔄 Ready for next phase: User scenarios or implementation planning

## Current Task Status

- ✅ Memory Bank directory structure created
- ✅ Project documentation initialized
- ✅ **ARCHITECT MODE COMPLETED**: System scheme definitions finished
- ✅ Component architecture design completed
- ✅ Architectural decision documentation completed
- 📋 Ready for scenario creation or implementation planning

## Session Context

**Session Goal**: Define comprehensive system architecture and component design for the Kafka microservices demonstration system.

**Mode**: Architect - Focus on high-level design, patterns, and architectural decisions

**Complexity Level Detected**: Level 2-3 (Moderate to Complex)

- Distributed microservices architecture
- Multiple technology integrations (Kafka, PostgreSQL, Docker)
- Event-driven communication patterns
- Containerization and orchestration

## Project State Assessment

### Working Components

- ✅ Complete microservices implementation with 3 services
- ✅ Docker containerization with docker-compose
- ✅ REST APIs with Swagger documentation  
- ✅ Database persistence with Entity Framework
- ✅ Event publishing infrastructure
- ✅ Comprehensive demo scripts created
- ✅ Health check endpoints

### Areas Needing Attention

- ⚠️ Kafka consumers in simulation mode (not fully connected)
- 🔄 System schemes (C1/C2) need definition
- 🔄 User scenarios need creation
- 🔄 Task planning and prioritization needed

## Next Steps Required

1. **System Scheme Definition** - Create C1 (system-level) and C2 (component-level) descriptions
2. **Scenario Creation** - Define user interaction scenarios with actors and touchpoints
3. **Task Planning** - Establish tasks.md with clear objectives
4. **Implementation Planning** - Determine enhancement priorities

## Development Environment Status

- **Services Running**: All 3 microservices operational in Docker
- **Infrastructure**: Kafka, Zookeeper, PostgreSQL running
- **Monitoring**: Kafka UI available at <http://localhost:8080>
- **APIs**: Swagger documentation accessible for all services

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

- Event-driven microservices with Kafka as message broker
- Database-per-service pattern with PostgreSQL
- REST APIs with comprehensive documentation
- Docker containerization for all components
- PowerShell automation scripts for demos
