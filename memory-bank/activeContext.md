# Active Context

## Current Focus

**Documentation Update and System Status Review (C1 Update Complete)**

## Current Goals

- âœ… Design comprehensive system architecture (C1 level) - COMPLETED
- âœ… Define component interactions and boundaries (C2 level) - COMPLETED  
- âœ… Establish architectural patterns and principles - COMPLETED
- âœ… Plan scalability and resilience strategies - COMPLETED
- âœ… Update system documentation with current project status - COMPLETED
- ðŸ”„ Ready for next phase: Kafka Integration Enhancement

## Current Task Status

- âœ… Memory Bank directory structure created
- âœ… Project documentation initialized
- âœ… **ARCHITECT MODE COMPLETED**: System scheme definitions finished
- âœ… Component architecture design completed
- âœ… Architectural decision documentation completed
- âœ… Clean architecture implementation completed (September 2025)
- âœ… System scheme C1 updated with current status
- ðŸ“‹ Ready for Kafka integration enhancement planning

## Session Context

**Session Goal**: Update system documentation and prepare for next implementation phase

**Mode**: Documentation Update and Status Review

**Current Status**: Clean architecture implementation successfully completed with all build validations passed

**Next Priority**: Kafka Integration Enhancement to replace simulation mode with real Kafka consumers

**Complexity Level Detected**: Level 2-3 (Moderate to Complex)

- Distributed microservices architecture
- Multiple technology integrations (Kafka, PostgreSQL, Docker)
- Event-driven communication patterns
- Containerization and orchestration

## Project State Assessment

### Working Components

- âœ… Complete microservices implementation with 3 services
- âœ… Docker containerization with docker-compose
- âœ… REST APIs with Swagger documentation  
- âœ… Database persistence with Entity Framework
- âœ… Event publishing infrastructure
- âœ… Comprehensive demo scripts created
- âœ… Health check endpoints

### Areas Needing Attention

- ðŸ”„ **PRIMARY FOCUS**: Kafka consumers in simulation mode (ready for real Kafka integration)
- ï¿½ Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms for Kafka consumers
- ï¿½ Performance optimization and load testing
- ï¿½ Advanced monitoring and observability features

## Next Steps Required

1. **Kafka Integration Enhancement** - Convert simulation mode to real Kafka consumers
2. **Error Handling Implementation** - Add robust retry mechanisms and failure handling
3. **Performance Testing** - Validate system under load conditions
4. **Monitoring Enhancement** - Implement comprehensive observability

## Development Environment Status

- **Services Running**: All 3 microservices operational in Docker
- **Infrastructure**: Kafka, Zookeeper, PostgreSQL running
- **Monitoring**: Kafka UI available at <http://localhost:8080>
- **APIs**: Swagger documentation accessible for all services

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

- Event-driven microservices with Kafka as message broker
- Database-per-service pattern with PostgreSQL
- REST APIs with comprehensive documentation
- Docker containerization for all components
- PowerShell automation scripts for demos
