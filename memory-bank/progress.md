  - Established proper separation of concerns following DDD principles
- **UPDATED**: System scheme C1 with current project status and implementation progress

## Doing

- System status documentation and architectural alignment
- Preparing for Kafka integration enhancement phase

## Latest Achievement: System Documentation Update

**Date**: September 16, 2025  
**Milestone**: Updated C1 and C2 system schemes with current implementation status

### Documentation Updates Completed

- Documented clean architecture implementation achievements
- Updated technology decisions to reflect DDD patterns
- Added implementation roadmap with next priorities
- Improved markdown formatting for better readability

✅ **C2 Component Scheme Enhancement**:

- Completely redesigned component diagrams with clean architecture layers
- Added detailed clean architecture implementation status
- Updated all service components with current structure
- Enhanced shared library documentation with domain/application/infrastructure layers
- Added migration strategy and next phase planning
- Documented architecture decision impacts

✅ **Progress Tracking Update**:

- Clarified completion milestones and dates
- Identified next phase priorities

## Latest Achievement: Clean Architecture Success

**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Milestone**: Successfully implemented clean architecture with compilation validation

### Technical Implementation Completed

✅ **Domain Layer Foundation**:

- `Order` and `OrderItem` entities with proper business logic encapsulation
- Value objects (`Money`, `CustomerId`, `ProductId`) for type safety
- Domain events (`OrderCreated`, `OrderConfirmed`, `OrderCompleted`, `OrderCancelled`)
- `BaseEntity` with domain event support and audit fields

✅ **Application Layer Contracts**:

- Repository patterns (`IOrderRepository`, `IUnitOfWork`)
- Application service interfaces (`IOrderApplicationService`)
- Command objects for application operations
- Proper dependency inversion and abstraction

✅ **Infrastructure Implementation**:

- `OrderRepository` with EF Core integration and type mapping
- `OrderMapper` for seamless conversion between database and domain models
- `UnitOfWork` implementation for transaction management
- Messaging abstractions ready for Kafka integration

✅ **Build Validation**:

- Resolved all type conversion errors between database models and domain entities
- Fixed nullable reference warnings in domain constructors
- Successful compilation with clean architecture structure verified

## Next

- Kafka integration enhancement to replace simulation mode
- Implementation planning based on architectural foundation
- Creative mode exploration for complex components if needed
- Additional scenario creation based on user needs
