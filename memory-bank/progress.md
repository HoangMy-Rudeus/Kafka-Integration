# Progress (Updated: 2025-09-15)

## Done

- Completed VAN mode initialization with Memory Bank structure
- Created comprehensive project documentation (projectbrief, productContext, techContext)
- Completed Architect mode with system scheme definitions
- Created C1 system architecture overview with event flow diagrams
- Created C2 component architecture with detailed service breakdowns
- Updated architect document with component analysis and decisions
- Established clear architectural patterns and integration points
- **COMPLETED**: User scenario creation with three comprehensive scenarios:
  - Developer/API: Order processing workflow scenario
  - Architect/Documentation: System architecture understanding scenario  
  - Student/Demo: Learning microservices through demo scenario
- Created scenarios index with usage guide and learning paths
- **COMPLETED**: Clean Architecture Implementation:
  - Created comprehensive Domain Layer with entities, value objects, and domain events
  - Implemented Application Layer with repository interfaces and command objects
  - Built Infrastructure Layer with repository implementations and type mapping
  - Resolved all compilation errors and validated successful build
  - Established proper separation of concerns following DDD principles

## Doing

- Clean architecture implementation complete - ready for dependency injection configuration and testing

## Latest Achievement: Clean Architecture Success

**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Milestone**: Successfully implemented clean architecture with compilation validation

### Technical Implementation Completed

✅ **Domain Layer Foundation**:
- `Order` and `OrderItem` entities with proper business logic encapsulation
- Value objects (`Money`, `CustomerId`, `ProductId`) for type safety
- Domain events (`OrderCreated`, `OrderConfirmed`, `OrderCompleted`, `OrderCancelled`)
- `BaseEntity` with domain event support and audit fields

✅ **Application Layer Contracts**:
- Repository patterns (`IOrderRepository`, `IUnitOfWork`)
- Application service interfaces (`IOrderApplicationService`)
- Command objects for application operations
- Proper dependency inversion and abstraction

✅ **Infrastructure Implementation**:
- `OrderRepository` with EF Core integration and type mapping
- `OrderMapper` for seamless conversion between database and domain models
- `UnitOfWork` implementation for transaction management
- Messaging abstractions ready for Kafka integration

✅ **Build Validation**:
- Resolved all type conversion errors between database models and domain entities
- Fixed nullable reference warnings in domain constructors
- Successful compilation with clean architecture structure verified

## Next

- Kafka integration enhancement to replace simulation mode
- Implementation planning based on architectural foundation
- Creative mode exploration for complex components if needed
- Additional scenario creation based on user needs
